# Sword of Fire Beta Builds
A simple medieval text based adventure game with some RPG elements. 
The latest builds are intended for me and developers only. As for I wanted this to be a project that everyone can see and commit to, I will release builds periodically.
# How to run the game
Running the game is simple. Download from the releases page, and then run the file that was included. If you are on linux or mac, you can either run Wine, DosBox, or any other program that can run .bat files. A linux and mac port, as long as an enhanced Windows port, is being considered.
# building and editing the code
If you want to edit the code, just download the latest build and open it in a traditional text editor and edit. If you want to make hacks, I'm fine with it, as long as you give me credit. 
# contributions
If you want to contribute to the project, I will give you permission as you request. Thanks guys.
# Translations
If you speak a foreign language, you can freely translate my work. Just remeber to give credit in the translation.
